#  Lab Sharing Using Docker

> Worked as an equal member of a four person team to develop webapp for sharing
docker containers over the network in lab infrastructure.

> This project provides students the GUI based containers having different tools
such as rstudio, eclipse, scilab, java, etc for lab practices.

> Webapp manages user space with session management and users data is saved
using volume sharing. MySQL database is used to manage container requests and
serve them. Port forwarding is used to map containers to client browsers on
request of client.
